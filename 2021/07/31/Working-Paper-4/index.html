        <p><strong>Sponsors: China, India, Iran, Japan,Singapore</strong></p>
<p><strong>Part I Effects of pandemic on women employment</strong></p>
<p>i. Recognizing among those respondents in employment when the pandemic struck, 5 percent of the women are now unemployed, compared with just 2.8 of the men.</p>
<p>ii. Noticing that LinkedIn data shows that the number of women in leadership positions has dropped significantly, leading to a reversal of progress in multiple industries in one to two years.</p>
<p>iii. Noticing that the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated automation and digitization, and intensified the damage to the labour market. Due to the gradual increase in “two shifts” and the combined effects of occupational segregation and other labour market dynamics, this epidemic is likely to have a traumatic impact on women’s future economy and may lead to poor reemployment prospects.</p>
<p><strong>Part II Effects of pandemic on women income</strong></p>
<p>i. Aware of that women have seen their earnings decline almost two-thirds more sharply than man, dropping by 16.5 percent on average since the pandemic began, compared with a drop of 10.1 percent for men.</p>
<p>ii. Noticing the situation as regards personal disposable income is almost identical at the global level. In every market surveyed, women report a steeper decline in the ability to pay for non-essential goods and services than men, ranging from 73% in South Africa to 19% in the UK.</p>
<p>iii. Realizing that the pandemic has shown that quarantine measures greatly weakened women’ s economic capacity and increased poverty rate and food insecurity of women living in poor regions.</p>
<p>iv. Further realizing that due to deep-rooted structural reasons, women’s income is 16% lower than men’s at global average level, and the wage gap in some countries can reach 35%.</p>
<p><strong>Part III Measures to alleviate women unemployment and loss of income in pandemic</strong></p>
<p>i. Implement social and income protection mechanisms for alternative employment models to ensure appropriate coverage for all workers in the formal and informal economy, with special attention to essential workers, part-time workers and the self employed.</p>
<p>ii. Design and test innovative solutions such as portable benefits which workers could carry across multiple jobs.</p>
<p>iii. Eliminate regulatory, legislative, and sociocultural barriers that prevent equal access of women to financial products and services.</p>
<p>iv. Call on governments to cooperate with UNICEF, UN Women, UNESCO, make good use of domestic financial institutions, such as banks, and encourage charity fund organizations or companies to provide financial assistance for women in urgent need and ensure women’s access to financial services and products.</p>
<p>v. Adopt gender-responsive budgeting informed by gender impact assessment to ensure that pandemic recovery measures foster a gender-inclusive workforce.</p>
<p>vi. Suggest instructing domestic citizens to modify conventional stereotypes towards women.</p>
<p><strong>Part III Controversies on the gender quota</strong></p>
<p>Noting the different attitudes towards the solution of gender quota;</p>
<p><strong>i.</strong> <strong>Supportive of gender quota</strong></p>
<p>Countries such as New Zealand is supportive of gender quota. The reason given is that gender quota contributes to the adjustments to the gender percentages in certain occupations, thus contributing to the process of gender equality in economics. To be more specifically, the supportive countries attach importance to the percentage of gender in employment, which is regarded by the supportive countries as a sign of gender equality in employment. </p>
<p><strong>ii. Opposite to gender quota</strong></p>
<p>Countries like Iran and Lichtenstein are opposite to gender quota. For instance, the reasons given by Iran are that the choices of employment by citizens, whether males or females, shouldn’t be interfered by mandatory standards of gender percentage of employment. Also, Iran reminds that gender quota is a mandatory standard controlling the gender percentage in employment intentionally, yet this can’t solve the fundamental issue of gender equality. For instance, the fundamental factor causing gender equality in Iran is conventional perspectives towards women. To ensure the successful implementation of gender equality, those stereotypes should be corrected first, or the execution of gender quota is just limited to balancing the percentages of gender in employment, rather than solve the problem in a sustainable way. </p>
<p>-Reminding that gender quota is not a mandatory method for the international society;</p>
<p>-Encouraging countries holding different views towards gender quota to choose the policy that suits the domestic situation of the nation, including but not limited to gender quota.</p>
<p><strong>ii.</strong> <strong>To reach a consensus</strong></p>
<p><strong>China</strong> advocates countries which have not implement gender-quota but hope to attempt this policy can conduct trials in areas like administration to test the effects of gender-quota. And China suggests governments organizing domestic assessment experts on political effectiveness to judge if gender-quota is completely suitable. If not, governments could take other measures and improve current policies to promote women participation in decision-making. </p>
<p><strong>Part IV Outlook</strong></p>
<p><strong>Outlook</strong></p>
<p>Noticing the violence against women during the is a commonplace, we divide into three parts to carry out a profound discussion. The three parts are domestic violence and society violence, sexual violence, and the laws and suggestions respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Domestic violence and society violence</strong></p>
<p>The control of the epidemic requires people to avoid gathering so isolation have increased the possibility of domestic violence. With people confined to their homes under the pandemic, many more women reached out for help. One of the main reasons is that some women have no financial resources which lead to the shrinking family income. Economic problems have led to domestic violence, however, this problem has yet to be resolved, however, seeking help for “family matters” is still a taboo in Japanese society. As a result, we should take proactive measures such as establishing emergency shelters for those who have suffered domestic violence to help women escape from the shadow pandemic.</p>
<p>At the same time, because of the increase in the female unemployment rate, the financial burden of the family has also led to an increase in the suicide rate. This is social violence against women.</p>
<p><strong>Sexual violence</strong></p>
<p>From <strong>Indian</strong> perspective, sexual violence is a big problem. </p>
<p>There are many reasons for the Washington posted delves into the root cause of the sexual violence in India. Some of the reasons is appalling such as wearing the dress with a teaser is refers to himself in trouble is to encourage victims to compromise and even persuade victims to marry raped. Moreover, India’s legal process is quite slow.</p>
<p>There are many main reasons. First, this dues to the lack of policewomen. Research shows that if there are more policewoman, women will be more willing to report rape case. Second, inadequate number of police. An article on the institution, thinks that India did not have enough the police to protect ordinary citizens, while the existing police often lack basic investigation skills training and equipment. Thirdly, the lack of public safety. Women generally lack of protection. Rape occurred on the bus, even the Indian authorities have said India is unsafe for women in public places. The fourth is not convicted. In India have reported the case of rape, only less than 26% of the cases have to convict prisoner. Last but not least, low status of women. For poor families, daughter’s dowry is a family burden greatly. Due to sex-selective abortions and female infanticide, India is the world’s one of the lowest populations of female to male ratio. In India, the son of the treatment is better than daughters, forever and easier to get the chance to receive education, so employment prospects are better.</p>
<p><strong>India</strong> also presented some laws to prevent sexual violence. In 2017, police in utter Pradesh’s chief minister about adidas tower when he took office, he decided to establish “Romeo” team to solve the problem of female security, however, this doesn’t make sense. Experts said that the culture of impunity in the criminal justice system is weak, the government’s measures and legal trial are powerless. As a result, India is eager to find some effective methods to solve these problems.</p>
<p><strong>law and advice</strong></p>
<p>The Asia-Pacific region lags behind the world in the level of legal protection for women, as well as the frequency and intensity of government voices on gender inequality. This stems from the traditions and religions of the Asia-pacific region, which, as we have mentioned, cannot be changed in a short period of time. So we propose that the law be used to protect women’s rights more effectively.</p>
<p>1.For developing countries, legal policies in favour of women should be established. Such as health products tax exemption, marriage compensation regulations, etc.</p>
<p>2.Improve laws and regulations on sexual violence (including marital sexual violence), cold violence, religious acts that injure women, abuse of women, and killing women, so as to simplify filing procedures, diversify forms of evidence collection, and make case handling process private. To make sure women speak up for themselves.</p>
<p>3.Increase the punishment of violence and illegal!! It is also suggested that special punishments should be carried out for some special crimes (such as bracelets for the perpetrators of symbolic violence, whipping, etc.)</p>
