        <p><strong>Sponsors: China, India, Singapore, Japan</strong></p>
<p><strong>Impacts of COVID pandemic on women</strong></p>
<p><u>Recognizing</u> impacts on women medical health are urgent, as majority of health workers on the front-line are women, leading women to higher risk in exposing themselves to the virus than men，</p>
<p><u>Fully aware of</u> the fact that COVID pandemic has intensified women unemployment, as women are often considered as the family care character when it comes to a crisis like pandemic, which forces women to abandon their career jobs，</p>
<p><u>Noticing</u> the lack of medical and daily necessities for front-line women health workers，</p>
<p><u>Realizing</u> that the social norm and policies such as nationally universal healthy insurance are not totally suitable for underdeveloped countries，</p>
<p><u>Recognizing</u> that the spread of the epidemic amplifies the gender gap, threatens the women’s health rights: </p>
<p>Physiological:</p>
<p>1.Male preference (according to statistics, female vaccination rate is only 66.4% of male)；</p>
<p>2.The family violence psychology；</p>
<p>3.Increased psychological stress among Women (Suicide rate rises in Japan)；</p>
<p>4.Impermanence Housework often increases；</p>
<p>Women’s right to health, long-term impairment, we are concerned about the following issues:</p>
<p>1.There is no legal support for health products in Asia-Pacific countries;</p>
<p>2.Under the influence of religious factors, female physiological organs are mutilated;</p>
<p>3.Sexist online violence and verbal violence;</p>
<p>4.Sexual violence, harassment；</p>
<p>5.Women’s burden of childcare，</p>
<p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
<p><em>Encourages</em> male to participate in family healthcare to balance the disproportionate contributions between men and women to childcare, housework, etc;</p>
<p><em>Suggests</em> increasing participation of women in medical research, for instance, in medical trials. Chinese doctor Li Lanjuan can serve as a model in women’s contribution to medical health;</p>
<p><em>Calls on</em> states with sufficient financial abilities to increase funding to countries which lack medical and economic power, in order to ensure that women and girls can access high quality, gender-appropriate healthcare;</p>
<p><em>Suggests</em> governments enabling women to participate more in political decision-making, contributing the wisdom of women to societies;</p>
<p><em>Recommends</em> governments to strengthen legislation on gender-based violence, enhance reporting privacy mechanism, simplify of filing procedures, and increase punishment measures;</p>
<p><em>Suggests</em> mandatory maternity leave for men to shoulder the burden of childcare with women;</p>
<p>China <em>proposes</em> the convening of another Global Leaders’ Meeting on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment in 2025 to contribute to women’s development in the post-pandemic era;</p>
<p>China <em>proposes</em> the convening of an annual conference under the framework of UN Women, which gathers women from all over the world to express and communicate on their opinions and prospects on gender parity.</p>
<p><strong>Effects of religious factors on women’s health in this pandemic</strong> </p>
<p>Noticing the first session mentioned some negative effects in this pandemic, but there are still a lot of problems in figuring out these adverse impacts. India personally thinks that we should not only explain the reasons and consequences of these inactive effects. India partly agrees with that some delegates said that education could solve the problem of religion on women’s health in this pandemic,but there should be more pragmatic actions. From Indian perspective, above all, education and religion have closely linked, so it is untoward for India to change this situation during a very short period. Secondly, for the reason that in this pandemic, India presented a policy which stopped schools,education institutions and research institutions. As a result, use education to solve religious factors in this pandemic is not actual;</p>
<p>Noticing the statement of Iranian delegate that owing to Iranian common belief in Islam, Iranian domestic health system are not allowed to achieve certain gender equality goals in underdeveloped areas. And Iran calls for assistance to improving dispensation in domestic underdeveloped areas.</p>
<p><strong>Outlook</strong></p>
<p>We consider the successful resolution of health issue as a prerequisite for further discussion of other issues.</p>
<p>Noticing the first session mentioned that health issue in both physical and mental aspects of female medical staff and civilians in this pandemic.</p>
<p>From the aspect of physiology, we noticed two factors, which are seedling tilt and family violence.</p>
<p>From the aspect of the mental health, we see obviously that the pressure of women had an enormous increase, for instance,the suicide rates of Japan’s women. As a research indicated, physical factors partly led to psychological problems. Besides these, women’s health in our daily life is also very important. At present,there are no legal support for sanitary products in Asia-Pacific countries. </p>
<p>Moreover, influenced by religious factors, female physiological organs were mutilated. Cyber-violence, verbal violence, sexual violence, harassment, unequal treatment within marriage such as cheating and sexual violence also influenced women a lot in this pandemic.</p>
<p>According to this situation, we propose some measures to solve it. Firstly, we should enforce an adequate criminal justice response plays an important role. Secondly, listen to women facing intersection forms of discrimination is a method to let women understand they T are taken as seriously as the men. Thirdly , increasing the number of women in leadership gives equal rights for both women and men on deciding significant things in the society. Last but not least, we should listen to girls to know their thoughts from a young age.</p>
