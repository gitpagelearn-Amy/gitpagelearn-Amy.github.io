            <p>An event which sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of myself was my first participation in the musical instrument competition held by my primary school.</p>
<p>I used to be a shy girl. Although I enjoyed playing a kind of traditional chinese musical instrument called the guzheng, I was not brave enough to play it in front of the public. As a result, almost no one knew that I could play the guzheng apart from my relatives and teachers.</p>
<p>However, this situation changed when I was in the third grade. My music teacher thought that I should be willing to take challenges to show everyone my unique skills and be more confident, so she recommended me to the school to take part in the instrument competition. I wanted to refuse, but my parents also encouraged me to take this rare opportunity. Finally, I made up my mind to prepare for this competition seriously as I did not want to let down the people in my life who have always supported me. During the preparation for this competition, I was still very nervous and anxious. However, my parents told me that the meaning and purpose of the competition was not only to win prizes, but also to help me become a better person through this kind of experience. From then on, I started to enjoy practicing playing the guzheng and felt happy because both my ability and my confidence improved. After several months of hard preparation, I won the second prize. I found I was able to achieve the success which I had wanted.</p>
<p>Through my experience of this event, I changed from being timid and introverted to being brave, confident and able to cherish any opportunities in my life. The music I played at the ten-year celebration of junior school was appreciated by my classmates and teachers. I am now a member of the high school symphonic band. I also take an active part in other club activities or subject competitions. I really enjoy the feeling of self-improvement.</p>

            <p>I set a personal goal for myself which was to pass IELTS with an overall band score of 6.5 as I will apply for university with this score </p>
<p>The preparation took over 4 months of hard work involved doing past papers and so on. With the help of my teachers, I completed and corrected all the daily tasks according to the plan made by my class advisor. As I also had a lot of homework to do from my school at the same time, I found that I was not used to such a fast-paced lifestyle. However, I soon got used to the workload as my teachers gave me guidance such as helping me find a balance between my school curriculum, IELTS study and activities held by school clubs. I started to enjoy a more well-organized life which gave me the experience of how to be focused, organized and then work more efficiently.</p>
<p> I felt very depressed for a period of time at first. Because I was studying a lot, yet made little progress. Then my teachers suggested a different way of collating my mistakes to make it easier to learn from them and this suggestion did help me a lot. Due to this, I found my weakness was not organized so I followed my teachers to overcome this.</p>
<p>As the old saying goes, ‘No pain, no gain.’ I achieved this goal a few days ago. Now, I am very grateful to my teachers and myself as I did not give up because of their encouragement. I realize that there is a strong possibility to achieve your personal goal with hard work. Being organized have improves the efficiency of my studying. As a result, I have more free time to pursue my own personal interests. </p>

            <p><strong>Sponsors: China, India, Iran, Japan,Singapore</strong></p>
<p><strong>Part I Effects of pandemic on women employment</strong></p>
<p>i. Recognizing among those respondents in employment when the pandemic struck, 5 percent of the women are now unemployed, compared with just 2.8 of the men.</p>
<p>ii. Noticing that LinkedIn data shows that the number of women in leadership positions has dropped significantly, leading to a reversal of progress in multiple industries in one to two years.</p>
<p>iii. Noticing that the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated automation and digitization, and intensified the damage to the labour market. Due to the gradual increase in “two shifts” and the combined effects of occupational segregation and other labour market dynamics, this epidemic is likely to have a traumatic impact on women’s future economy and may lead to poor reemployment prospects.</p>
<p><strong>Part II Effects of pandemic on women income</strong></p>
<p>i. Aware of that women have seen their earnings decline almost two-thirds more sharply than man, dropping by 16.5 percent on average since the pandemic began, compared with a drop of 10.1 percent for men.</p>
<p>ii. Noticing the situation as regards personal disposable income is almost identical at the global level. In every market surveyed, women report a steeper decline in the ability to pay for non-essential goods and services than men, ranging from 73% in South Africa to 19% in the UK.</p>
<p>iii. Realizing that the pandemic has shown that quarantine measures greatly weakened women’ s economic capacity and increased poverty rate and food insecurity of women living in poor regions.</p>
<p>iv. Further realizing that due to deep-rooted structural reasons, women’s income is 16% lower than men’s at global average level, and the wage gap in some countries can reach 35%.</p>
<p><strong>Part III Measures to alleviate women unemployment and loss of income in pandemic</strong></p>
<p>i. Implement social and income protection mechanisms for alternative employment models to ensure appropriate coverage for all workers in the formal and informal economy, with special attention to essential workers, part-time workers and the self employed.</p>
<p>ii. Design and test innovative solutions such as portable benefits which workers could carry across multiple jobs.</p>
<p>iii. Eliminate regulatory, legislative, and sociocultural barriers that prevent equal access of women to financial products and services.</p>
<p>iv. Call on governments to cooperate with UNICEF, UN Women, UNESCO, make good use of domestic financial institutions, such as banks, and encourage charity fund organizations or companies to provide financial assistance for women in urgent need and ensure women’s access to financial services and products.</p>
<p>v. Adopt gender-responsive budgeting informed by gender impact assessment to ensure that pandemic recovery measures foster a gender-inclusive workforce.</p>
<p>vi. Suggest instructing domestic citizens to modify conventional stereotypes towards women.</p>
<p><strong>Part III Controversies on the gender quota</strong></p>
<p>Noting the different attitudes towards the solution of gender quota;</p>
<p><strong>i.</strong> <strong>Supportive of gender quota</strong></p>
<p>Countries such as New Zealand is supportive of gender quota. The reason given is that gender quota contributes to the adjustments to the gender percentages in certain occupations, thus contributing to the process of gender equality in economics. To be more specifically, the supportive countries attach importance to the percentage of gender in employment, which is regarded by the supportive countries as a sign of gender equality in employment. </p>
<p><strong>ii. Opposite to gender quota</strong></p>
<p>Countries like Iran and Lichtenstein are opposite to gender quota. For instance, the reasons given by Iran are that the choices of employment by citizens, whether males or females, shouldn’t be interfered by mandatory standards of gender percentage of employment. Also, Iran reminds that gender quota is a mandatory standard controlling the gender percentage in employment intentionally, yet this can’t solve the fundamental issue of gender equality. For instance, the fundamental factor causing gender equality in Iran is conventional perspectives towards women. To ensure the successful implementation of gender equality, those stereotypes should be corrected first, or the execution of gender quota is just limited to balancing the percentages of gender in employment, rather than solve the problem in a sustainable way. </p>
<p>-Reminding that gender quota is not a mandatory method for the international society;</p>
<p>-Encouraging countries holding different views towards gender quota to choose the policy that suits the domestic situation of the nation, including but not limited to gender quota.</p>
<p><strong>ii.</strong> <strong>To reach a consensus</strong></p>
<p><strong>China</strong> advocates countries which have not implement gender-quota but hope to attempt this policy can conduct trials in areas like administration to test the effects of gender-quota. And China suggests governments organizing domestic assessment experts on political effectiveness to judge if gender-quota is completely suitable. If not, governments could take other measures and improve current policies to promote women participation in decision-making. </p>
<p><strong>Part IV Outlook</strong></p>
<p><strong>Outlook</strong></p>
<p>Noticing the violence against women during the is a commonplace, we divide into three parts to carry out a profound discussion. The three parts are domestic violence and society violence, sexual violence, and the laws and suggestions respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Domestic violence and society violence</strong></p>
<p>The control of the epidemic requires people to avoid gathering so isolation have increased the possibility of domestic violence. With people confined to their homes under the pandemic, many more women reached out for help. One of the main reasons is that some women have no financial resources which lead to the shrinking family income. Economic problems have led to domestic violence, however, this problem has yet to be resolved, however, seeking help for “family matters” is still a taboo in Japanese society. As a result, we should take proactive measures such as establishing emergency shelters for those who have suffered domestic violence to help women escape from the shadow pandemic.</p>
<p>At the same time, because of the increase in the female unemployment rate, the financial burden of the family has also led to an increase in the suicide rate. This is social violence against women.</p>
<p><strong>Sexual violence</strong></p>
<p>From <strong>Indian</strong> perspective, sexual violence is a big problem. </p>
<p>There are many reasons for the Washington posted delves into the root cause of the sexual violence in India. Some of the reasons is appalling such as wearing the dress with a teaser is refers to himself in trouble is to encourage victims to compromise and even persuade victims to marry raped. Moreover, India’s legal process is quite slow.</p>
<p>There are many main reasons. First, this dues to the lack of policewomen. Research shows that if there are more policewoman, women will be more willing to report rape case. Second, inadequate number of police. An article on the institution, thinks that India did not have enough the police to protect ordinary citizens, while the existing police often lack basic investigation skills training and equipment. Thirdly, the lack of public safety. Women generally lack of protection. Rape occurred on the bus, even the Indian authorities have said India is unsafe for women in public places. The fourth is not convicted. In India have reported the case of rape, only less than 26% of the cases have to convict prisoner. Last but not least, low status of women. For poor families, daughter’s dowry is a family burden greatly. Due to sex-selective abortions and female infanticide, India is the world’s one of the lowest populations of female to male ratio. In India, the son of the treatment is better than daughters, forever and easier to get the chance to receive education, so employment prospects are better.</p>
<p><strong>India</strong> also presented some laws to prevent sexual violence. In 2017, police in utter Pradesh’s chief minister about adidas tower when he took office, he decided to establish “Romeo” team to solve the problem of female security, however, this doesn’t make sense. Experts said that the culture of impunity in the criminal justice system is weak, the government’s measures and legal trial are powerless. As a result, India is eager to find some effective methods to solve these problems.</p>
<p><strong>law and advice</strong></p>
<p>The Asia-Pacific region lags behind the world in the level of legal protection for women, as well as the frequency and intensity of government voices on gender inequality. This stems from the traditions and religions of the Asia-pacific region, which, as we have mentioned, cannot be changed in a short period of time. So we propose that the law be used to protect women’s rights more effectively.</p>
<p>1.For developing countries, legal policies in favour of women should be established. Such as health products tax exemption, marriage compensation regulations, etc.</p>
<p>2.Improve laws and regulations on sexual violence (including marital sexual violence), cold violence, religious acts that injure women, abuse of women, and killing women, so as to simplify filing procedures, diversify forms of evidence collection, and make case handling process private. To make sure women speak up for themselves.</p>
<p>3.Increase the punishment of violence and illegal!! It is also suggested that special punishments should be carried out for some special crimes (such as bracelets for the perpetrators of symbolic violence, whipping, etc.)</p>

<p><strong>Impacts of COVID pandemic on women</strong></p>
<p><u>Recognizing</u> impacts on women medical health are urgent, as majority of health workers on the front-line are women, leading women to higher risk in exposing themselves to the virus than men，</p>
<p><u>Fully aware of</u> the fact that COVID pandemic has intensified women unemployment, as women are often considered as the family care character when it comes to a crisis like pandemic, which forces women to abandon their career jobs，</p>
<p><u>Noticing</u> the lack of medical and daily necessities for front-line women health workers，</p>
<p><u>Realizing</u> that the social norm and policies such as nationally universal healthy insurance are not totally suitable for underdeveloped countries，</p>
<p><u>Recognizing</u> that the spread of the epidemic amplifies the gender gap, threatens the women’s health rights: </p>
<p>Physiological:</p>
<p>1.Male preference (according to statistics, female vaccination rate is only 66.4% of male)；</p>
<p>2.The family violence psychology；</p>
<p>3.Increased psychological stress among Women (Suicide rate rises in Japan)；</p>
<p>4.Impermanence Housework often increases；</p>
<p>Women’s right to health, long-term impairment, we are concerned about the following issues:</p>
<p>1.There is no legal support for health products in Asia-Pacific countries;</p>
<p>2.Under the influence of religious factors, female physiological organs are mutilated;</p>
<p>3.Sexist online violence and verbal violence;</p>
<p>4.Sexual violence, harassment；</p>
<p>5.Women’s burden of childcare，</p>
<p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
<p><em>Encourages</em> male to participate in family healthcare to balance the disproportionate contributions between men and women to childcare, housework, etc;</p>
<p><em>Suggests</em> increasing participation of women in medical research, for instance, in medical trials. Chinese doctor Li Lanjuan can serve as a model in women’s contribution to medical health;</p>
<p><em>Calls on</em> states with sufficient financial abilities to increase funding to countries which lack medical and economic power, in order to ensure that women and girls can access high quality, gender-appropriate healthcare;</p>
<p><em>Suggests</em> governments enabling women to participate more in political decision-making, contributing the wisdom of women to societies;</p>
<p><em>Recommends</em> governments to strengthen legislation on gender-based violence, enhance reporting privacy mechanism, simplify of filing procedures, and increase punishment measures;</p>
<p><em>Suggests</em> mandatory maternity leave for men to shoulder the burden of childcare with women;</p>
<p>China <em>proposes</em> the convening of another Global Leaders’ Meeting on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment in 2025 to contribute to women’s development in the post-pandemic era;</p>
<p>China <em>proposes</em> the convening of an annual conference under the framework of UN Women, which gathers women from all over the world to express and communicate on their opinions and prospects on gender parity.</p>
<p><strong>Effects of religious factors on women’s health in this pandemic</strong> </p>
<p>Noticing the first session mentioned some negative effects in this pandemic, but there are still a lot of problems in figuring out these adverse impacts. India personally thinks that we should not only explain the reasons and consequences of these inactive effects. India partly agrees with that some delegates said that education could solve the problem of religion on women’s health in this pandemic,but there should be more pragmatic actions. From Indian perspective, above all, education and religion have closely linked, so it is untoward for India to change this situation during a very short period. Secondly, for the reason that in this pandemic, India presented a policy which stopped schools,education institutions and research institutions. As a result, use education to solve religious factors in this pandemic is not actual;</p>
<p>Noticing the statement of Iranian delegate that owing to Iranian common belief in Islam, Iranian domestic health system are not allowed to achieve certain gender equality goals in underdeveloped areas. And Iran calls for assistance to improving dispensation in domestic underdeveloped areas.</p>
<p><strong>Outlook</strong></p>
<p>We consider the successful resolution of health issue as a prerequisite for further discussion of other issues.</p>
<p>Noticing the first session mentioned that health issue in both physical and mental aspects of female medical staff and civilians in this pandemic.</p>
<p>From the aspect of physiology, we noticed two factors, which are seedling tilt and family violence.</p>
<p>From the aspect of the mental health, we see obviously that the pressure of women had an enormous increase, for instance,the suicide rates of Japan’s women. As a research indicated, physical factors partly led to psychological problems. Besides these, women’s health in our daily life is also very important. At present,there are no legal support for sanitary products in Asia-Pacific countries. </p>
<p>Moreover, influenced by religious factors, female physiological organs were mutilated. Cyber-violence, verbal violence, sexual violence, harassment, unequal treatment within marriage such as cheating and sexual violence also influenced women a lot in this pandemic.</p>
<p>According to this situation, we propose some measures to solve it. Firstly, we should enforce an adequate criminal justice response plays an important role. Secondly, listen to women facing intersection forms of discrimination is a method to let women understand they T are taken as seriously as the men. Thirdly , increasing the number of women in leadership gives equal rights for both women and men on deciding significant things in the society. Last but not least, we should listen to girls to know their thoughts from a young age.</p>

            <p><strong>Delegate:  Zhao Jie</strong><br><strong>Delegation:  Japan</strong><br><strong>Committee:  The Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly</strong><br><strong>Topic:  Gender equality in COVID pandemic</strong><br><strong>School:  Jinling High School</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The patriarchal clan society led to gender discrimination as most men had an advantage over women in physical strength, however, gender inequality still exists these days. Since the spread of the COVID-19, some situations even have made it more serious. For example, many companies tend to fire female employees to ensure their profits. This has caused dissatisfaction among many people.<br>As the builders and contributors of society, women have the right to fight for and take back the opportunities they should have. Moreover, eliminating gender discrimination can improve social civilization, increase productivity, and promote the emergence of more talents. So it is important for us to help women and take actions to eliminate gender inequality.</p>
<p><strong>Past actions</strong></p>
<p>The United Nations passed The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women at the General Assembly on December 18, 1979, and it entered into force in September 1981. It is an international convention on the rights of women and promotes the feminist movement through international treaties. It is also an important international human rights instrument formulated by the United Nations to eliminate discrimination against women and strive for gender equality. The convention establishes rules to protect women’s rights in politics, law, work, education, medical services, business activities and family relations. UN Women claimed that many women’s industries were hit hard by the COVID-19. Women are increasingly facing the difficulty of making a living. There will be more than 47 million women and children living below the poverty line in the world. At the same time, UN Women called on all the countries to strengthen solidarity and cooperation to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment.<br>Since Japanese companies use the annual merit-based wage system for their wages, companies are tend to recruit male employees. In order to solve the serious gender discrimination of Japanese companies in recruiting employees, Japan has banned filling in gender and pasting photos on resumes.</p>
<p><strong>Position of Japan</strong></p>
<p>Due to the influence of Japanese traditional culture, there is still serious gender discrimination in Japanese society. The COVID-19 has made gender discrimination harming Japanese women’s lives more, especially those who living at the bottom of society. Gender inequality has no benefits to the development and civilization progress, so Japan supports the elimination of gender discrimination. As a developed country, Japan will actively take equal rights measures.<br>On December 18, the World Economic Forum (WEF) released the “2018 Global Gender Difference Report”. Among the 149 countries surveyed, Japan ranked 110th (with a total score of 0.662) and was still the last place in the G7 group. The main reason for Japan’s low ranking is its low scores in the economic and political sectors. Excessive income gap between men and women (103, score 0.527) and large gap in the number of men and women in management positions (129, score 0.152) have a greater impact. In the education and health care parts, Japan has achieved a high score of nearly full score.<br>According to this report, Japan will investigate if companies treat male and female employees differently and introduce policies to narrow the wage gap between male and female employees to ensure women’s income. At the same time, the government will stipulate the ratio of male and female employees in enterprises to solve the problem of high unemployment among women. Japan will also encourage women to participate in politics and improve women’s social status. At the same time, Japan will maintain equality in education and health. We will also fight against those who think that women should do housework to take care of children and the elderly for unpaid work in home. Develop social discussions on a larger scale and awaken people’s awareness to achieve gender equality is the result that beneficial to the public.</p>

            <p><strong>1.Choose one aspect of gender inequality, and list more than TWO evidences to back up your statement.</strong></p>
<p>There are gender disparity in political empowerment.</p>
<p>Evidence 1:Women in national parliaments are also severely underrepresented. Till April 2021, of 46204 parliaments seats across the world, only 25.5% (11770) of all national parliamentarians are women. The website where you find this: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://data.ipu.org/women-ranking?month=4&amp;year=2021">http://data.ipu.org/women-ranking?month=4&amp;year=2021</a></p>
<p>Evidence 2:Some reports say that very few women have served as head of state in the highest political position. Only 22 countries have had women leaders as the head of state or government, and there has never been a woman in the highest position in other 119 countries. The website where you find this: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/about-us/">https://www.unwomen.org/en/about-us/</a> about-un-women.</p>
<p><strong>2.Find one treaty/ protocol/ declaration/ collective action plan signed based on UN resolution or regional consensus. State your opinion to it, like advantage/ disadvantage, historical milestone, leading to some act or so.</strong> </p>
<p>  The United Nations General Assembly passed resolution on COVID-19. The resolution was passed by 169 out of 193 countries. Only the United States and Israel objected it. Member states strengthen international cooperation, solidarity and mutual assistance to fight against COVID-19. The resolution stated that international cooperation, multilateralism, solidarity and mutual assistance are the only ways for the world to effectively respond to global crises such as COVID-19. It called on all countries to treat everyone equally. The resolution supported the global ceasefire initiative proposed by the UN Secretary-General, paid close attention to the impact of the epidemic on areas of armed conflict, and continued to support UN peacekeeping operations. The resolution urged member states, political leaders and religious leaders to not only promote tolerance and unity but also oppose violence and discrimination. It also urged member states to strengthen health systems and social care systems. Moreover, it urged member states and other stakeholders to deal with the direct social and economic impact of COVID-19. This resolution cracked down on unilateralism, protectionism and hegemonism. At the same time, it promoted international cooperation and encouraged the practice of multilateralism. Many countries cooperated to effectively control the epidemic. For example, Russia assisted Wuhan with personal protection and medical supplies many times. Pakistan, with its underdeveloped economy and low level of medical care, also solicited medical supplies from public hospitals across the whole country to provide assistance to our country, which was very touching. Our country has also donated supplies to many countries and sent teams of medical experts.</p>
<p><strong>3.Choose ONE delegation you prefer and state reasons. This answer will be the critical reference to delegation arrangement.</strong></p>
<p>  My favourite United Nations delegation is the Chinese delegation. Because the Chinese delegation can always put forward creative initiatives that are beneficial to the world according to current events. For example, the thought of building a community with a shared future for mankind was supported by most countries.</p>

            <p>My Chinese name is Zhao Jie and my English name is Amy. I am from the tenth grade of the international Department of Jinling High School.</p>
<p>My family thinks I am an introverted girl but they do not worry about me. However, they also advise me to be more confident so that I can get more chances and be more energetic in activities. As a result, I will gain more experience. My friends generally think I am very helpful and patient and one reason for this is that I am happy to repeat explaining exercises until they understand. Moreover,they also said I am generous because I never mind lending my books and stationery to them. Furthermore,people in our community consider me as a polite but shy girl as a result of that I am not very active in the activities which usually taken part in by a lot of people.</p>
<p>One of my proudest achievements is that I can play guzheng and trombone well. I kept practising guzheng almost every day until I got to the certificate of highest level for amateur scholars. For this reason,I was chosen as a member of the school’s guzheng team from primary school to middle school and I have taken part in many shows and competitions during that period. Now I play the trombone in the orchestra of my high school which has taught me how to work well with others as well as do everything with a sense of responsibility.</p>
