<p>Information enters the amygdala (alarm system) through the eyes.

<p>When we are aware of the existence of the negative self, it is actually helpful to wake up the wise self (willpower). It’s wrong to want to get rid of the negative self (primitive impulse). Because getting rid of desire leads to depression and getting rid of fear leads to injury.</p>

<li>Know that the self-control system and survival instinct may conflict or cooperate with each other (want to buy something but give up for its high price).</li>
<li>The brain can be reshaped according to the requirements of people. With a certain amount of training, the density of certain areas in the brain will increase. As a result, there will be more grey matter.</li>

<li><strong>Early civilization</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>About 700 B.C., the Celts, who lived in Western Europe, continued to move into the British Isles. One of them was called the Britons, which the name Britain probably came from. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Roman invasion</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In 43 A.D., Britain transformed it into a province of the Roman Empire. In 409, the Roman garrison was forced to withdraw from Britain, and Rome’s rule over Britain came to an end.</p>
<h4 id="MEDIEVAL-TIMES"><a href="#MEDIEVAL-TIMES" class="headerlink" title="MEDIEVAL TIMES"></a><em>MEDIEVAL TIMES</em></h4><ul>
<li><strong>Anglo Saxon</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>At the beginning of the 5th century, after the withdrawal of the Romans, the Anglo Saxons and the Jutes conquered Britain. The angles called Britain “angland”.(Homophonic English, the origin of the English name)</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 7th century, the land became private property, and aristocrats, landowners, dependent farmers and slaves appeared, which was generally considered to be the beginning of the feudal process in British society. Christianity was introduced into England at the end of the 6th century.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Danish invasion</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>During the Danish occupation, the process of British feudalization accelerated.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Norman Conquest</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>William, Duke of Normandy in France, led his army to invade in 1066. In October of the same year, he entered London and was crowned as King William 1.</p>
<p>The powerful monarchy established by William after his conquest played a positive role in consolidating the feudal order. (Great Charter)</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/svaWc9"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/01/26/svaWc9.jpg" alt="svaWc9.jpg"></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Watt Taylor Uprising</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In 1380, King Richard II increased the poll tax in order to collect the expenses of the Hundred Years’ War, which led to the break of uprising in May 1381, organized by the bricklayer watt Taylor. Although the uprising failed, it cracks down the feudal serfdom in England. In the 15th century, the feudal lord class changed– new aristocrats appeared, and capitalist management was adopted.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hundred Years’ War</strong></li>

            <p>My friends and I searched some information about garbage classification. Here it is.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Definition"><a href="#Definition" class="headerlink" title="Definition"></a>Definition</h3><p>Garbage classification generally refers to a series of activities, including storage classification throwing and transportation according to certain regulations or standards, so as to transform it into public resources. It has social, economic and ecological benefits.</p>
<h3 id="Why-do-we-need-to-do-refuse-classification"><a href="#Why-do-we-need-to-do-refuse-classification" class="headerlink" title="Why do we need to do refuse classification?"></a>Why do we need to do refuse classification?</h3><p>With the development of the technology, the environment is changing for the worse. White pollution, greenhouse effect, desertification and so on are all endangering our lives. So the classification of waste is necessary. In the past, people just threw the rubbish into the sea. It imperils the safety of the marine animals like polar bears. Second, refuse classification can greatly reduce land occupation because some substances in waste are not easy to degrade. Third, turning waste into treasure is helpful to improve the rate of recycling efficiency.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-separate-garbage"><a href="#How-to-separate-garbage" class="headerlink" title="How to separate garbage"></a>How to separate garbage</h3><p><em>The recycling is divided into five parts, which includes the waste paper, plastic, glass, metal and cloth.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The waste paper covers newspapers, magazines, books, and all kinds of wrapping paper. It is necessary to mention that tissue is not included because it dissolves in water easily.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The plastic covers plastic bags, plastic package, plastic tableware, plastic toothbrush, plastic cup and so on.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The glass mainly covers glass bottles, broken glass. However, the mirror is not included.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The metal covers different kinds of cans.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The cloth covers waste clothes, tablecloth, schoolbag and shoes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If these things can be recycled, the resources will be saved.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The other garbage covers tissue, shell, and dust. If they are buried properly, they can reduce the pollution of water and soil.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The kitchen garbage covers bones, pericarp, and leftovers. After dealing with them by biotechnology, every tons of them can produce 0.6-0.7 tons of organic fertilizer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The harmful garbage covers batteries, fluorescent tubes, bulbs, mercurial thermometer, overdue pedicure and so on. All of them contain toxic substances, so they are recycled specially.</p>

I am not willing to chat with people who are not familiar with me. However, I am always willing to help people in need. In this term, I succeeded in doing housework for a whole month for the first time. I also could play some new songs by guzheng. Moreover, I attended every lessons held by computer science club and the orchestra of school. There is something that I can improve. I did not try my best in academic achievements so I will work harder. Also, I should do more exercise. This can be solved by arranging my time properly. I need to overcome these problems. I did get a lot of help in this term. My teachers and classmates helped me with my assignments patiently. My classmates helped me hand in my homework and lent their notes to me when meetings held by school and our lessons were the same time. One of my friends in another class helped me pass the volleyball exam. Finally, one of my goals is to achieve A in all the subjects. As a result, I need to learn how to make a reasonable plan. The help I want is the proper supervision of others.</p>

Among them, the orchestra of school and computer club held more activities than the audio-visual art club. The reason for joining the orchestra is that I am interested in music. In the orchestra, I learned how to play trombone   which I had never played before for only six days to accompany the flag raising ceremony. So far, I have attended flag raising ceremony accompaniment for three times. These activities make me understand that everything is possible. In the future, I will continue to actively practice playing trombone. The reason for joining the computer science club is that I knew little about computer science before and hoped to improve my knowledge. The main activities held by this club are taking lessons. Through the course of one whole term, I really broadened my horizons and improved my ability. However, if I had finished my homework more actively, I might have got more skills. In addition, I set up my own website to record and share my life. The success of website construction has brought me a great sense of achievement and joy. However, my update speed is too slow. As a result, I decided to write more articles during the winter holiday. I also took part in a weekly reading seminar. The purpose of the meeting is to share good books with others, release pressure and relax. I think all members had made preparations before sharing the books. I have also shared two chapters of the book named the willpower instinct. I think this book can help people develop good habits. I will continue taking part in this activity in the future and benefit from book sharing.</p>

            <p>When a person speak or sing to a microphone, the sound wave makes the diaphragm of the microphone vibrate. So the coil which is connected to diaphragm cuts the magnetic induction line in the magnetic field and generates current. Moreover,the magnitude of the current depends on the loudness of the sound. In Physics,we call that electromagnetic induction.</p>
